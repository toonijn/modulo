# Building a class for modular arithmetic
## Writing modern C++ is not easy.

To run the slides locally `node`, `npm` and `clang++` need to be present in the path.

```
npm install
npm run frontend
```

On some slides, code can be compiled interactively. For this another server needs to be running as well.
```
npm run backend
```
